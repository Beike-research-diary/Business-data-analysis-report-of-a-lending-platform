## What I learned from this project
Data organization: Based on Deepseek to locate open source datasets containing specified keywords, clean and integrate 30w+ loan and repayment data, complete field type conversion and outlier processing.  

Data Exploration: Through visual analysis of user profiles, repayment and re-borrowing behaviors, product structure and overdue repayment rate characteristics, RFM model is applied to complete user stratification.  

Proposed 6 business strategies, including “optimization of interest rates for small loans”, and measured the average daily demand for capital reserves based on the 3σ principle.
